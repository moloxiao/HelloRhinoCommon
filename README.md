# Rhino Command Test

This project was created to participate in the [XFrame RhinoCommon-Coding-Challenge-2024](https://github.com/X-Frame/RhinoCommon-Coding-Challenge-2024).

Two primary goals:
1. Demonstrate basic programming skills and the ability to complete related development tasks;
2. Accumulate domain knowledge to facilitate in-depth and engaging communication  

Therefore, we plan to achieve these two goals by completing these tasks :  
| Goal id | task state | plan or finish date | version | task introduction |
| :--:| :---: | :---:| :---: | :--------- |
| 1, 2 | Finish | 04-06-2024 | P0.0,1 | implement a minimum viable product (MVP) |
| 1, 2 | Finish | 04-06-2024 | P0.0.1 | Set up the environment  |
| 1, 2 | TODO   | 05-06-2024 | P0.0.2 | Refactor code and modularize code |




# Version
