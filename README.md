# Rhino Command Test

This project was created to participate in the [XFrame RhinoCommon-Coding-Challenge-2024](https://github.com/X-Frame/RhinoCommon-Coding-Challenge-2024).

Two primary goals:
1. Demonstrate basic programming skills and the ability to complete related development tasks;
2. Accumulate domain knowledge to facilitate in-depth and engaging communication  

Therefore, we plan to achieve these two goals by completing these tasks [Still under continuous update] :  
| Goal id | task state | plan or finish date | version | task introduction |
| :--:| :---: | :---:| :---: | :--------- |
| 1, 2 | Finish | 04-06-2024 | P0.0,1 | implement a minimum viable product (MVP) |
| 1, 2 | Finish | 04-06-2024 | P0.0.1 | Set up the environment  |
| 1, 2 | TODO   | 05-06-2024 | P0.0.2 | Refactor code and modularize code |


# Version  
| version | date | State | introduction |
| :--:| :---: | :---: | :----- |
| P0.0.3 | 05-06-2024 | TODO   | ...... |
| [P0.0.2](#p0-0-2) | 05-06-2024 | TODO   | Refactor the code and organize it in a way that is familiar to me |
| [P0.0.1](#p0-0-1) | 04-06-2024 | Finish | Initialize the Mac development environment. Implement a simplified version |

## P0.0.2
1. Independent configuration file
2. Independent calculation implementation
3. Optional: Include unit tests

## P0.0.1  
1. Set up the environment
2. implement a minimum viable product (MVP)


# Spend Time

| 3 | P0.0.1 | first mini MVP | 04-06-2024 | 0.3 | 1.5  |
| 4 | P0.0.1 | read require again and init readme   | 04-06-2024 | 0.8 | 2.3 |
| 5 | P0.0.2 | Refactor the code to separate the calculation logic into Agent and BoxManager. | 05-06-2024 | 1 | 3.3  |

supplementary statement :
1. **id:2** Initially, I tried to manually create the plugin through ChatGPT, but it didn't work. I then turned to Google to check the official documentation and set up the basic environment by installing VS plugins.
2. **id:3** It took me about 20 minutes to refactor the code. I wanted to use a separate namespace, but I'm not familiar with Visual Studio and C#'s namespace mechanism. After spending 30 minutes without successfully referencing it, I'll set aside namespaces for now and ensure it runs correctly first.
